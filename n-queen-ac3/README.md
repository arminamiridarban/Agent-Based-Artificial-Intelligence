### N-Queen CSP problem:

#### Problem:
You are tasked with solving the N-Queen problem for an arbitrary N using the **AC-3 (Arc Consistency 3)** algorithm. In the N-Queen problem, the goal is to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other. This means that no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

### Task 1: Problem Representation
1. Define the N-Queen problem as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) with:
   - **Variables**: Define the variables for this CSP.
   - **Domains**: Define the domains for the variables.
   - **Constraints**: Specify the constraints in terms of which variables must not conflict with each other.
2. Apply the AC-3 algorithm to the N-Queen problem.
   - Write the code to apply the AC-3 algorithm to the N-Queen problem.
   - Check the code if its working properly with all number of chess board size.
